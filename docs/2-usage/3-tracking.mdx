`observe`, `when`, `computed`, and React `observer` components automatically track when you call `get()` or use array looping functions, so you generally don't have to think about it unless you want to specifically optimize. When an observable is tracked, it will re-run on any changes anywhere within the observable and its children.

These operations track:
1. Call `get()` on an observable: `settings.get()`
2. Array looping functions (shallow listener): `arr.map(settings.accounts, () => ...)`
3. Accessing array length (shallow listener): `if (arr.length > 0) ...`
4. Object.keys (shallow listener): `Object.keys(settings)`

These operation do not track:
1. Accessing through an observable: `state.settings`
2. Call `peek()` on an observable: `settings.peek()`

Some examples of the automatic behavior:

```js
const state = observable({
    settings: {
        theme: 'dark'
    },
    chats: {
        messages: [
            { id: 0, text: 'hi' }
        ]
    }
})

observe(() => {
    // Example 1:
    const theme = state.settings.theme.get()
    // Tracking [state.settings.theme] because of get()

    // Example 2:
    const settings = state.settings
    // Not tracking because it's an object

    const theme = settings.theme.get()
    // Tracking [state.settings.theme] because of get()

    // Example 3:
    const themeObs = state.settings.theme
    // Not tracking with no get()

    // Example 4:
    state.chats.messages.map(m => <Message key={m.get().id} message={m} />)
    // Tracking [state.chats.messages (shallow)] because of map()

    // Example 5:
    Object.keys(state.settings)
    // Tracking [state.settings (shallow)]
})
```

The automatic behavior can be modified with two observable functions:

<div style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}>
| Function     | Value      | Tracked |
| -----------  | ---------- | ------- |
| `get()`      | raw        | yes     |
| `get(true)`  | raw        | shallow |
| `peek()`     | raw        | no      |
</div>

### get()

`get` returns the raw data of an observable and tracks it, so you can work with it without doing any further tracking. You may want to use `get()` to:

- Get the value of an observable wrapper of a primitive
- Track this object and not its individual fields. Minimizing the number of listeners is better for performance.

```js
    const theme = state.settings.theme.get()
    // âœ… Tracking [state.settings.theme]
```

### peek()

`peek()` returns the raw value in the same way as `get()`, but it does not automatically track it. Use this when you don't want the component/observing context to update when the value changes.

```js
    const theme = state.settings.theme.peek()
    // Not tracking
```

### shallow modifier

`get()` observes recursively by default, so any child changing will cause an update. You can modify it to be a shallow listener by just adding a `true` parameter. This can be useful when a component only needs to re-render if an object's keys or an array's items change.

```jsx
const state = observable({ messages: [] })

observe(() => {
    // Only need this to update when messages added/removed
    const messages = state.messages.get(true)

    console.log('Latest message', messages[0])
})
```
