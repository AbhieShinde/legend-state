You may want to modify multiple observables at once without triggering callbacks for each change. Batching postpones renders and listeners until the end of the batch.

Batching can be done in two ways, wrapping between `beginBatch()` and `endBatch()` or in a callback with `batch(callback)`.

```js
import { batch, beginBatch, endBatch } from "@legendapp/state"

// Wrap in begin and end
beginBatch()
doManyChanges()
endBatch()

// Or batch with a callback
batch(() => {
    doManyChanges()
})
```

## When to batch

As we all know, you generally shouldn't optimize pre-emptively. `observable` functions like `assign` already batch changes under the hood, so listeners don't get called until the full change is complete. In many cases like setting unrelated observables you don't need to worry about it. But if rendering or an observer depends on many related observables, it's best to batch setting them so that the observer/component re-runs only once.

Batching is important in a few key situations:

### Observables depend on each other

Use `batch` to delay computations/renders until all dependent changes are complete.

```js
const name = observable({ first: '', last: '' })

const fullName = computed(() => `${name.first} ${name.last}`)

observe(() => console.log('fullName = ', fullName.get()))

// ❌ fullName notifies its listeners with incomplete state
// fullName = "First "
name.first.set('First')

// ✅ fullName notifies with final state
// fullName = "First Last"
batch(() => {
    name.first.set('First')
    name.last.set('Last')
})
```

### Prevent excessive renders

Making multiple changes in a row can cause the React hook to re-render multiple times when it should wait until changes are complete.

```js
const name = observable({ items: [] })

function addItems() {
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i ++) {
        obs.items.push({ text: `Item ${i}` })
    }
}

// ❌ This can render 1000 times while pushing to the array
addItems()

// ✅ Batching delays until complete and renders once
batch(addItems)
```

### When persisting

If you are using `persistObservable` to automatically persist your changes, you can prevent excessive writes by delaying persistence until changes are complete. Pushing to an array 1000 times could save to storage 1000 times, which could be very slow!
