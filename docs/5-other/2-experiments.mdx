## Configuring extra features

Starting in version 1.3.0 the following configuration options are available. We see this pattern as a good way to enable some useful features that only some users would want, and to allow for a library of plugins that enable extra features on top of observables.

These functions:

1. Add a function or property to all observables
2. Augment the Observable TypeScript interface to add the functions, so just importing the file adds the interface

### enableDirectAccess

This enables accessing and setting the raw value of an observable directly. It's a shorthand for `get()` and `set(...)`.

```js
import { observable } from '@legendapp/state';
import { enableDirectAccess } from '@legendapp/state/config/enableDirectAccess';
enableDirectAccess()

const obs = observable({ test: 'hi', num: 0 })

// $ is a shorthand for get()
const testValue = obs.test.$

// Assign to $ as a shorthand for set()
obs.test.$ = 'hello'

// Assign objects too just like you can with set()
obs.$ = { test: 'hello' }

// Incrementing works as you'd expect
obs.$ ++
```

### enableReactDirectRender

This enables rendering observables directly into React, which creates an element that's reactive to the observable changing. This replaces `enableLegendStateReact()`, which will be deprecated in later versions.

```jsx
import { observable } from '@legendapp/state';
import { enableReactDirectRender } from '@legendapp/state/config/enableReactDirectRender';
enableReactDirectRender()

const obs = observable({ test: 'hi' })

function Component() {
    // The observable can now be rendered directly to create a self-reactive elemtn
    return <div>{obs.test}</div>
}
```

### enableReactUse

This adds a `use()` function to all observables, which gets the value and makes the component reactive to the observable changing. It simply runs `useSelector(obs)` under the hood.

```jsx
import { observable } from '@legendapp/state';
import { enableReactUse } from '@legendapp/state/config/enableReactUse';
enableReactUse()

const obs = observable({ test: 'hi' })

function Component() {
    // This makes this component responsive to test changing
    const test = obs.test.use()

    return <div>{test}</div>
}
```

### enableDirectPeek

This enables accessing and setting the raw value of an observable directly without tracking or notifying listeners. Getting with `._` is a shorthand for `peek()` and assigning to `._` modifies the underlying data without notifying. Modifying data without notifying is likely necessary in only very specific scenarios so use it with care.

```js
import { observable } from '@legendapp/state';
import { enableDirectPeek } from '@legendapp/state/config/enableDirectPeek';
enableDirectPeek()

const obs = observable({ test: 'hi', num: 0 })

// _ is a shorthand for peek()
const testValue = obs.test._

// Assign to _ to modify the underlying object without notifying listeners
obs.test._ = 'hello'

// Assign objects too
obs._ = { test: 'hello' }
```
